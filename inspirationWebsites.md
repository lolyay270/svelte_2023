# 3 Example Websites for Element Incorporation
## Website 1 ([Coulisse Gallery](https://www.coulisse-gallery.com/artists))
### Why did you choose these particular sites?
I really like this site because it shows lots of images with small amount of words.

My website is planned to show mainly images with only the names of the cats.

### What elements appeal to you and why? Reference some principles of modern web design.
- Animatic on website load
  - The animatic shows the title of the website, which is also the purpose.
  - I dislike visiting a website that I dont know what it is for.
- Hovering names shows images of their work
  - I really like the simplicity of just artist names without being overloaded with information about them.
  - The font follows good typography and is really easy to read with it being large and not a serif font.
- Dark/light mode toggle
  - Gives accessability to people with light sensitivity.
  - I personally have light sensitivity and this saves me from getting migraines.
### What specific elements will you incorporate into your own design? How? Where can they be seen in your assignment?
I will incorporate the hovering names to show art images.
- I will put this onto my second page where all the selected breeds will be made into a component.
- Within the component the names of cats will replace the artist names, and about 5 images of cats will show in place of the art.
