## Website 1 - [Coulisse Gallery](https://www.coulisse-gallery.com/artists)
### Why did you choose these particular sites?
- I really like this site because it shows lots of images with small amount of words.
- My website is planned to show mainly images with only the names of the cats.
### What elements appeal to you and why? Reference some principles of modern web design.
- Animatic on website load
  - The animatic shows the title of the website, which is also the purpose.
  - I dislike visiting a website that I dont know what it is for.
- Hovering names shows images of their work
  - I really like the simplicity of just artist names without being overloaded with information about them.
  - The font follows good typography and is really easy to read with it being large and not a serif font.
- Dark/light mode toggle
  - Gives Accessability to people with light sensitivity.
  - I personally have light sensitivity and this saves me from getting migraines.
### What specific elements will you incorporate into your own design? How? Where can they be seen in your assignment?
I will incorporate the hovering names to show art images.
- I will put this onto my second page where all the selected breeds will be made into a component.
- Within the component the names of cats will replace the artist names, and about 5 images of cats will show in place of the art.

## Website 2 - [Fluffy Hugs NFTs](https://nft.fluffyhugs.io/gallery)
### Why did you choose this particular site?
- I am making a cat cafe website, with lots of images.
- This website show lots of images in its gallery and I really like how they have done it.
- I really like the home page that allows you to scroll through lots of cartoon animations, and most are interactive with hover or click and drag effects
### What elements appeal to you and why? Reference some principles of modern web design.
- The toolbar on the left that hold the filters is really nice, it allows users the ability to filter, instead of infinitely scrolling (which I cannot do with my disability)
  - It follows the principal of consistency. We often experience nav menus, shortcuts or similar on the left of a website.
  - It also follows [Neilsen's 6th Heuristic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), Recognition rather than recall, for the button icons. There are no words, yet we can recognise what each filter does. This includes the reset button.
- The ability to scroll infinitely in BOTH directions is really interesting. I have seen websites infinitely scroll downwards, but you cannot scroll up when the page loads
  - This adds more usability. I feel the scoll upwards adds more effeciency in finding the NFT you want (without using the filter) and it makes the process more fun. "Usability can be described as (...) safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability)
- The jiggle animation on the home page words adds life to a page that might be completely still and boring
  - This adds to the appeal of the typography of the website. I have dived into the code and altered the visuals to see if english is readable [see here](https://github.com/lolyay270/svelte_2023/assets/127159745/f878c297-b38b-4f2f-bd94-7f9a9238e2d8)
### What specific elements will you incorporate into your own design? How? Where can they be seen in your assignment?
I will incorporate the infinite scroll in both directions
- It will show on the second page where the large cat breed names will show.
- The scroll will loop through all the cat breeds.
- I will use this [example](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/how-to-implement-infinite-scrolling-with-javascript--cms-37055t) to help me code this.

## Website 3 - [Magnet Web Design](https://magnet.co/)
### Why did you choose this particular site?
- I found this website on the Awwwards site. I really liked the simplistinc design
- I was inspired by how much inforation they could get through to the users without cluttering the website. 
### What elements appeal to you and why? Reference some principles of modern web design.
- I really like the use of grids and flex boxes to show lots of information or images (like [here](https://github.com/lolyay270/svelte_2023/assets/127159745/6fdc7623-5ae2-4738-92aa-ebd4a6ddc86a))
  - I want to use this effectice use of grids to show images of cats.
  - The website follows very good consistency with grids.
  - The website feels paced well as you scroll and the information is where you would expect it
- The sketches all around the webite give it warmth, even in the grayscale colour palette.
  - The sketches show good Aesthetic and minimalist design according to [Neilsen's 8th Heuristic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
  - Magnet could have used any random stock image to fill the space, but they chose to add cute drawings.
  - The drawings are all used in places that add to the User's experience rather than distracting them.
- The website has shortcuts and multiple ways to get to the same place
  - I feel this follows Neilsen's #7 Heuristic, Flexibility and efficiency of use
  - It allows people to get to places they know of faster.
  - For example, if you scroll down quite a way you will find [Solutions](https://github.com/lolyay270/svelte_2023/assets/127159745/023dfd3d-fc02-4737-9471-fc243c596b84), where you can click on the images shown. But you can also click on the nav button, which is always visible, for the same page.
### What specific elements will you incorporate into your own design? How? Where can they be seen in your assignment?
I want to incorporate the efficient use of grids.
- This will be shown on both pages of my website. I will use grids to hold images and cards.
- I want the user to see images that are all similar size, and not have images that offset the location of other images
