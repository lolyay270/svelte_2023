# Kitties Website - By Jenna Boyes
## Description
I am making a website using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to complete my Intro to Web Development assignment for my Bachelor of IT at Otago Polytechnic.

I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete the requirements given to me. 
## How to use my website
This website will never be hosted by a server. This means the only way to access it is to clone this repository. 

In the terminal where you cloned it, enter the command `npm install` and wait for the terminal to finish installing files.

Then enter the command `npm run dev -- --open` and it should open a browser page with my website showing.

If this fails type `u` into the console and it will show you the link that your PC is hosting the website. Mine is `http://localhost:5173/`, but yours is likely different. Just put this into any browser while the terminal shows the website is being hosted.
