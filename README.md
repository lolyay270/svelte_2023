# Kitties Website - By Jenna Boyes
## Description
I am making a website using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to complete my Intro to Web Development assignment for my Bachelor of IT at Otago Polytechnic.

I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete the requirements given to me. 

I personally have faced challenges with JavaScript as it is a new language to me and I have had previous experience in HTML and CSS.


## Motivations
The main motivations for this website are the fact I had to make it for an assigment, and my gorgeous and annoying boys, Eskie and Elmo.
[insert images of cat children here]


## Future Improvements If I Had The Time
I would like to make the images on Other page slide out of the breed name, instead of instantly appearing.

I currently do not have the JavaScript skills nor the will power to make this work.

I would also like to allow the users to click on the cats on the homepage and this would link to the correct cat on Other page.


## How to use my website
This website will never be hosted by a server. This means the only way to access it is to clone this repository. 

In the terminal where you cloned it, enter the command `npm install` and wait for the terminal to finish installing files.

Then enter the command `npm run dev -- --open` and it should open a browser page with my website showing.

If this fails type `u` into the console and it will show you the url that your PC is hosting the website. Mine is `http://localhost:5173/`, but your's is likely different. 
Just copy paste this into any browser while the terminal shows the website is being hosted.


## How to Use My Project
The project is not made for showing much information. It allows people to put pictures of cats to the names of the breeds.

Every time you refresh the home page, the images shown will cycle.

If people want to see more of a specific breed then can click on the navigation button with "Other" shown.

This will allow people to hover over the names of the cat breeds and it will show 5 images of that breed.

## Credits
All work is done by myself. With the help of tech forums and Polytechnic Lecturers guiding me. 

## Can You Contribute?
No, sorry. This is a personal assignment that if it was edited by people other than myself, I would fail.

I will likely not adding to this repo after the assignment is completed, therefore I will not let others add to it either.
